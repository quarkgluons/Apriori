This is a program I wrote as an assignment fro a datamining class that I took in college. Its supposed to implement the 
apriori algorithm.

I am little unsure whether its giving the correct results.
I am uploading on github just for the heck of it. The code is hardly readable and its a anti-DRY philosophy.
Pathetic code.
